		<!--
			JaWS allows several ways to register a HTML element and render it's HTML code.
			If you don't need to listen to events from the client browser, the following
			method may be a good choice. 

			It calls jaws.RequestWriter.A() via the UiState. One parameter is required,
			plus a variable number of optional parameters.
			
			The first parameter is something that will determine the inner HTML of
			the <a> tag. If it's a jaws.HTMLGetter or a template.HTML string, the
			data is output as-is. If it's a jaws.StringGetter or string, the data
			is HTML escaped.

			If the first parameter is a jaws.HTMLGetter or jaws.StringGetter, it
			is also used as the 'UI tag' of the created element.

			'UI tags' are used when letting JaWS know which Elements need to be updated.

			UI tags can be anything comparable, but we disallow primitive types
			such as integers or strings. If you really need to use a string as a UI tag,
			use the type alias jaws.Tag. In most places where you can pass a tag
			you can also pass a slice of tags or something that implements
			jaws.TagGetter.

			We use UI tags to mark tagged HTML elements as 'dirty', meaning they 
			need to be updated. We do this by calling 'Jaws.Dirty(tag)'.

			On regular intervals (by default 100ms) JaWS will update the browser
			HTML elements as needed.

			Finally, we provide a string with HTML attributes as the optional
			parameters that are copied into the HTML closing tag as-is.

			Other optional parameters include more UI tags to associate with
			the element or event handlers (jaws.ClickHandler and jaws.EventHandler).
		-->
		{{$.A .CarsLink `href="/cars" class="btn btn-primary mb-3"`}}

		<!--
			jaws.RequestWriter.Text() needs a jaws.StringSetter as the
			first parameter. JaWS will call it's JawsGetString and
			JawsSetString as needed, and will mark it's tags as dirty
			automatically - meaning that typing in one browser window
			is immediately reflected in others.

			It's important that all data that underlies what is being
			shown or manipulated in the UI is protected by mutexes and
			that the get and set functions enforce this.
		-->
		<div class="mb-3">
			<label class="form-label">Text
				{{$.Text .InputText `class="form-control"`}}
			</label>
			<span>Try entering 'fail' or 'cat'.</span>
		</div>

		<!--
			jaws.RequestWriter.Checkbox needs a jaws.BoolSetter.

			Normally you would use a sync.Mutex or sync.RWMutex
			to protect from race conditions, but we can also
			use atomics. Here we use an atomic.Bool.

			The RequestWriter methods are named after the HTML elements
			or HTML "input" element types they create, but their data 
			sources are named after the Go types they use.
		-->

		<!-- 
			JaWS UI tags are used to logically link JaWS Elements together. When a
			Jaws.Dirty(tags) call is made, all Elements with one or more of the
			given tags have their JawsUpdate() method called eventually.

			Here, both UI Elements share the same uiInputRange{} for their data,
			and JaWS will automatically add that as a tag. So when the Range
			gets modified, the Span can set it's attributes and value in the
			uiInputRange.JawsGetHTML() method.

			Radio buttons require special handling because selecting
			one in a group of several de-selects all the others, and
			keeping this in sync with the server and other browsers
			takes care.

			You can either handle this yourself using Request.Radio(),
			using the boolean event functions for the individual radio
			buttons and coordinating in your server, or use
			RequestWriter.RadioGroup(). Here, we will use the latter.

			RadioGroup() requires a jaws.NamedBoolArray and returns a 
			slice of jaws.RadioElement, which we use to render the HTML
			entities with the Radio() and Label() methods.

		<!--
			jaws.RequestWriter.Select requires a jaws.SelectHandler,
			which is something that implements both jaws.Container

		<!--
			jaws.RequestWriter.Button needs something to decide
			the inner HTML of the button (same as $.A or $.Span),
			and normally also a jaws.ClickHandler to react to
			button presses. These can be the same object.

			If the button has a static inner HTML, you can just
			put it directly as the first argument and then
			pass the jaws.ClickHandler as an optional argument.

			If the button element itself doesn't have a 
			click handler defined, or the handler returns 
			jaws.ErrEventUnhandled, the click event gets
			propagated to the nearest parent JaWS Element
			according to the browsers DOM.

			It is recommended to set the 'name' HTML attribute
			on the elements and check that the name
			matches what's expected in the click handler.
