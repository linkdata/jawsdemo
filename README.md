# jawsdemo

Simple demo application for [JaWS](https://github.com/linkdata/jaws), with extensive comments on how to use it.

Maybe start by having a look at the comments in `assets/index.html`.

## Use

`go run .`

Open multiple web browser pages to `http://localhost:8081/`. Play around with the controls on the pages. As you alter the values in one web page, the others match the changes in real time.
